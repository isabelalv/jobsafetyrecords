# Job Safety Analysis Records Library

This application allows a safety manager of some facility to maintain a library of JSA (Job Safety Analysis) records. For each activity conducted at the facility, there is a record containing the activity under analysis, and a collection of jobs steps, each with a set of recommended controls.

#### What is a JSA?
A JSA (sometimes called a JHA) is used by EHS (Environmental Health and Safety) professionals to record hazards that exist in the workplace as they correspond to specific tasks a worker would perform. By identifying controls for known hazards and reviewing them regularly with staff, risks associated with known hazards can be mitigated
and reduced.
